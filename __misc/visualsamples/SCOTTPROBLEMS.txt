Scott says:
 no picture
 too blocky
 should ask are you a player or a serious dater
 option to pick time and place for a date
 no dating site has a thing where you can actually make appointments for dates
 webcam option possibly webcam date opetion similar to woo me
 rate your dates section
 the rate your date section could be used after date has occurred if you liked your date lets them know, if not interested lets them know
 you ahvent got an adavanced search yet
 unique selling point of your site is the making dates section which allows you to arrange a date in local locations local to the user
 also plays on the title of the website when scott "met" michelle
 as most people who use dating websites get sick of talking to fake people who they never meet, or people who just talk on e mail but never meet
 could also set it up so you have a section for people who dont mind "meeting" within one or two e mails and a section for those who prefer to get to know each other over say a months worth of e mails before "meeting"
 match.com, mysinglefriend.com datingdirect.com etc don't have a facility that identifies local dating meeting spots
 you could also use the site to arrnage mass meets have one in local locations each month for people who are at "meeting stage" to see their partner and see how they get on
 could also expand and use it not just as a dating site but as a way for singles wqho meet and get on but dont clik in terms of partners to refer their single buddies to meet the person they just met instead
 again puts emphasis on the "meeting" part of the title
 could also expand it for people who just want to expand their social circle
 but struggle to make friends
 have sub categories like comic books, flower arranging, roller skating whatever, a search engine that scours these events then hooks members up who are interested in similar things
 also offers another unique selling point as THE ONLY dating site that is still worth going on after you have a aprtner as you can use it to just meet other like minded people who enjoy your social activity
 plus adds loads of other dating stuff that other sites have then you ahve all the standard crap, plus the unique selling points above which makes your site both compete with the big boys and have something unique in its own right
 i personally think a dating site where you are guaranteed events you could go to and you ahve a fair idea of how comfortable who youre talking to is in terms of meeting within a set number of e mails a good one because it means you dont easte time on people who want to e mail for months on end, and the people that do want to do that can talk to people that do because it will display it on their pr
 ofile
 makes every mother fucker happy
 there you go
 now going downstairs to watch some shit
 give me a cut of the profit when it becomes successful
